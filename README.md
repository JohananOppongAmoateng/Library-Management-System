# Library-Management-System
A library management system is designed to efficiently manage the operations and resources of a library. Here are some common features found in library management systems:

1. Catalog Management: Maintain a centralized catalog of books, periodicals, media, and other library materials. This includes features for adding, editing, and deleting items from the catalog, as well as searching and browsing capabilities for users.

2. User Management: Manage user accounts and profiles, including registration, authentication, and user roles (e.g., students, faculty, staff). Users may be able to view their borrowing history, manage their personal information, and place holds or requests for materials.

3. Circulation and Borrowing: Facilitate the borrowing and lending process, including check-in and check-out of library materials. This feature may include due date management, loan renewals, holds, and notifications for overdue items.

4. Reservation and Request Management: Enable users to reserve or request items that are currently unavailable or in high demand. Users can be notified when the requested items become available.

5. Fine and Fee Management: Track and manage fines, fees, and penalties for overdue materials, lost items, or other library-related charges. Provide an interface for users to view and pay fines online.

6. Catalog Search and Discovery: Provide a user-friendly search interface for users to find and discover library materials based on title, author, subject, ISBN, or other criteria. Implement advanced search options, filters, and sorting capabilities.
